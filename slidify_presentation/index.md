## Executive Summary
* Many struggle to understand the impact of discrete variables in statistical models
* Investigate automobile effiencey as a familiar and accesible example
* Design a simple application targeting non-statisticians to:
    * Interactively model fuel efficiency (MPG) using a variety of continuous variables<br>(e.g. weight, engine displacement)
    * Compare model fit after adding a discrete variable (transmission type)
* Host the application online for all to experience!
