## Executive Summary
* Many struggle to understand the impact of discrete variables in statistical models
* Investigate automobile effiencey as a familiar and accesible example
* Design a simple application targeting non-statisticians to:
    * Interactively model fuel efficiency (MPG) using a variety of continuous variables<br>(e.g. weight, engine displacement)
    * Compare model fit after adding a discrete variable (transmission type)
* Host the application online for all to experience!

```{r ex_plot, echo = FALSE}
    # Load libraries
    library(datasets)
    
    # Read 'mtcars' dataset
    dat <- mtcars
    
    # Fit linear model for mpg ~ am
    fit <- lm(mpg ~ am, dat)
    fitCoef <- summary(fit)$coefficients
    fitText <- c(paste("Intercept:", round(fitCoef[1, 1], digits = 4)),
                 paste("Intercept P-Value:", signif(fitCoef[1, 4], digits = 4)),
                 paste("Slope:", round(fitCoef[2, 1], digits = 4)),
                 paste("Slope P-Value:", signif(fitCoef[2, 4], digits = 4)))
    
    # Scatter plot mpg ~ am
    # Adds line for 'fit'
    plot(mpg ~ am, dat, xlab = "", ylab = "MPG", xaxt = "n")
